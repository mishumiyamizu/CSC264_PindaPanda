                The giant panda (<i>A. melanoleuca</i>; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin:
                dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda),
                is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its
                bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant
                panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a
                neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora,
                the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves
                making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild
                will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat
                in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they
                may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or
                bananas along with specially prepared food. <br /><br />
                <h2>
                    Do you know that panda used to be heavy carnivores like
                    grizzly bear however due to migration of location, they eat
                    bamboo. That is why they are panda bear!
                </h2>
                <br />
                The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
                mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
                As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development,
                the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where
                it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable
                species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity
                inside China and another 27 outside the country
                <br /><br />
                <h3>Conservation</h3>
                <br />
                The giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued
                habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, and by a very low
                birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is
                currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its
                historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern
                China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.
                <br /><br />
                Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han
                Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the
                panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of
                exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not
                until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been
                exhibited in China's zoos.

                Here is a video from National Geographic recording an interview
                of one of the director in China conservation. Ony after years
                after years of research can the scientist found a way to
                increase their survival rate up yo 90%. This is only survival
                rate for them to live in the conservation centre, it would be a
                different story when they are release into the wild however.

                Even though our country Malaysia does not have Giant Panda as an
                original species that live and breed in our habitat, we do
                conserve a pair of giant panda in our national zoo which is Zoo
                Negara. Those pandas have been given a suitable condition
                temperature and proper diet to ensure they are well conserve.
                Since we do not have a lots of pandas in our conservation, it is
                important for you to visit at a right time. We included
                timetable to visit at right time according to amount of
                visitors.
